We are releasing the app in closed beta in the beginning to mid January 2022.

After this we will be working towards:

- [ ] Saving and restoring an ongoing game
- [ ] Reliable tracking - even for hyper-bullet

We also have the following goals in the long run:
- [ ] Ensure support of more *exotic* chess sets
- [ ] Reduce data usage of the app
- [ ] Reduce battery usage of the app
- [ ] Improve general usability and user experience
- [ ] Allow tracking of illegal moves

- [ ] Possibly releasing parts of the code as open-source software

If there is enough demand we will also cosider:
